# Cryptocurrencies

During this project, I helped Accountability Accounting analyze and classify crypto data. They wanted the data cleaned, segmented, and grouped, so they could better understand which cryptocurrencies are the best to invest in. In turn, they can provide better support to their clients by understanding which cryptos show the most promise in the future.

The data used in this project was not perfect, so I had to process it so that it could be used in a machine learning model. I decided to use an unsupervised machine learning model, because there is no known output. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. In this deliverable we used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

To analyze the data we stuck to a four step process:
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The overall findings of each of these methods are included in the "crypto_clustering" jupyter notebook file.
