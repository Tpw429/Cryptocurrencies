# Cryptocurrencies

During this project, I helped Accountability Accounting analyze and classify crypto data. They wanted the data cleaned, segmented, and grouped, so they could better understand which cryptocurrencies are the best to invest in. In turn, they can provide better support to their clients by understanding which cryptos show the most promise in the future.

The data used in this project was nowhere near perfect, so I had to prep it to work for the machine learning model. I decided to use an unsupervised machine learning model, because there was no known output. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. In this deliverable we used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

To analyze the data I used a four step process:
- Preprocessed the Data for PCA
- Reduced Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustered Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualized Cryptocurrencies Results

The overall findings of each of these methods are included in the "crypto_clustering" jupyter notebook file.
